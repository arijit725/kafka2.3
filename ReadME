Kafka Producer:
===============

Kafka Producer will send messages to kafka topic.
User has complete previleges to configure Kafka Producer. 
In this example:
	 1. KafkaProducerService configures Kafka producer.
	 2. KafkaProducerWrapper specify producing message key & value type. 
	 	Also here KafkaProducerWrapper are pre-configured for a particular topic, 
	 	which means you need to create individual KafkaProducerWrapper for each topic.
	 	KafkaProducerWrapper will have sendSync() and sendAsync() method to send records to kafka.	 	
	 3. To send message to kafka in this application, One needs to create message of type KafkaMessageDto.
	 
	 
Note:
Role of key in Kafka:
	1. The key is commonly used for partitioning and is particularly important if modeling a Kafka topic as a table in KSQL (or KTable in Kafka Streams) for query or join purposes.	
	2. If a valid partition number is specified that partition will be used when sending the record. If no partition is specified but a key is present a partition will be chosen using a hash of the key. 
	If neither key nor partition is present a partition will be assigned in a round-robin fashion.
